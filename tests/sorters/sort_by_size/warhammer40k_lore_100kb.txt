Warhammer 40,000 is a dystopian science fantasy universe set in the far future, where humanity survives under the rule of the Imperium of Man. The galaxy is vast, ancient, and hostile, filled with countless alien species, supernatural entities, and the remnants of civilizations that rose and fell long before recorded human history. There is no peace among the stars, only an unending cycle of war, decay, and fanaticism. 

The Imperium of Man is a totalitarian, theocratic empire spanning more than a million worlds. It is ruled in the name of the Emperor of Mankind, a near-dead god-like being sustained by ancient technology on the Golden Throne. Communication and travel between star systems rely on the Warp, a parallel dimension of psychic energy inhabited by daemons and Chaos Gods. This dependence makes every journey dangerous and every message uncertain. The Imperium endures not because it is efficient or benevolent, but because it is relentless. 

Chaos is the greatest existential threat to humanity. It is both a metaphysical force and a reflection of mortal emotion, given form within the Warp. The Chaos Gods—Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, and Slaanesh—feed on war, ambition, despair, and excess respectively. Their servants include traitor Space Marines, corrupted humans, and daemonic legions. Once loyal heroes, many of these traitors fell during the galaxy-shattering civil war known as the Horus Heresy. 

Beyond humanity and Chaos exist countless alien races collectively labeled as xenos. The Orks are a brutal, warlike species driven purely by instinct and violence. The Aeldari are an ancient, declining race whose arrogance once birthed a Chaos God. The Necrons are undying machines awakened from aeons of stasis, seeking to reclaim the galaxy. The Tyranids are extragalactic predators, consuming all biomass in their path.

There is no peace among the stars, only an unending cycle of war, decay, and fanaticism. 

The Imperium of Man is a totalitarian, theocratic empire spanning more than a million worlds. It is ruled in the name of the Emperor of Mankind, a near-dead god-like being sustained by ancient technology on the Golden Throne. Communication and travel between star systems rely on the Warp, a parallel dimension of psychic energy inhabited by daemons and Chaos Gods. This dependence makes every journey dangerous and every message uncertain. The Imperium endures not because it is efficient or benevolent, but because it is relentless. 

Chaos is the greatest existential threat to humanity. It is both a metaphysical force and a reflection of mortal emotion, given form within the Warp. The Chaos Gods—Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, and Slaanesh—feed on war, ambition, despair, and excess respectively. Their servants include traitor Space Marines, corrupted humans, and daemonic legions. Once loyal heroes, many of these traitors fell during the galaxy-shattering civil war known as the Horus Heresy. 

Beyond humanity and Chaos exist countless alien races collectively labeled as xenos. The Orks are a brutal, warlike species driven purely by instinct and violence. The Aeldari are an ancient, declining race whose arrogance once birthed a Chaos God. The Necrons are undying machines awakened from aeons of stasis, seeking to reclaim the galaxy. The Tyranids are extragalactic predators, consuming all biomass in their path. 

Warhammer 40,000 is a dystopian science fantasy universe set in the far future, where humanity survives under the rule of the Imperium of Man. The galaxy is vast, ancient, and hostile, filled with countless alien species, supernatural entities, and the remnants of civilizations that rose and fell long before recorded human history.

Communication and travel between star systems rely on the Warp, a parallel dimension of psychic energy inhabited by daemons and Chaos Gods. This dependence makes every journey dangerous and every message uncertain. The Imperium endures not because it is efficient or benevolent, but because it is relentless. 

Chaos is the greatest existential threat to humanity. It is both a metaphysical force and a reflection of mortal emotion, given form within the Warp. The Chaos Gods—Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, and Slaanesh—feed on war, ambition, despair, and excess respectively. Their servants include traitor Space Marines, corrupted humans, and daemonic legions. Once loyal heroes, many of these traitors fell during the galaxy-shattering civil war known as the Horus Heresy. 

Beyond humanity and Chaos exist countless alien races collectively labeled as xenos. The Orks are a brutal, warlike species driven purely by instinct and violence. The Aeldari are an ancient, declining race whose arrogance once birthed a Chaos God. The Necrons are undying machines awakened from aeons of stasis, seeking to reclaim the galaxy. The Tyranids are extragalactic predators, consuming all biomass in their path. 

Warhammer 40,000 is a dystopian science fantasy universe set in the far future, where humanity survives under the rule of the Imperium of Man. The galaxy is vast, ancient, and hostile, filled with countless alien species, supernatural entities, and the remnants of civilizations that rose and fell long before recorded human history. There is no peace among the stars, only an unending cycle of war, decay, and fanaticism. 

The Imperium of Man is a totalitarian, theocratic empire spanning more than a million worlds.
