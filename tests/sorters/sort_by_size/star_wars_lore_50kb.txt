Star Wars is a science fantasy universe set in a distant galaxy, where advanced technology coexists with ancient traditions, mysticism, and endless conflict. At the heart of the setting lies the Force, an energy field created by all living things, binding the galaxy together. Those sensitive to the Force can learn to manipulate it, gaining abilities that appear miraculous to ordinary beings. The struggle over how the Force should be used defines much of galactic history. 

For thousands of years, the Galactic Republic served as a representative government, uniting thousands of star systems under a shared legal and economic framework. Protected by the Jedi Order, the Republic valued diplomacy over conquest, but its bureaucracy grew slow and corrupt. Hidden within its political system, the Sith patiently worked to undermine it from within, using deception rather than open warfare to achieve dominance. 

The Jedi Order followed a strict code emphasizing discipline, selflessness, and emotional restraint. In contrast, the Sith embraced passion, ambition, and the pursuit of power. This philosophical divide led to countless wars across galactic history. Though often believed extinct, the Sith survived in secret, following the Rule of Two, ensuring that their power grew concentrated and focused over time. 

The fall of the Republic marked the rise of the Galactic Empire, an authoritarian regime built on fear and military supremacy. Emperor Palpatine, once a respected statesman, revealed himself as a Sith Lord and seized absolute control. The Jedi were hunted down and nearly exterminated, while planetary systems were brought into line through intimidation, propaganda, and overwhelming force. 

Opposition to the Empire formed slowly, as senators, soldiers, and civilians united in secret. This resistance evolved into the Rebel Alliance, a decentralized movement relying on courage, sacrifice, and hope rather than superior firepower. The Alliance fought to restore freedom to the galaxy, believing that tyranny was neither inevitable nor eternal. 

Across millennia, the galaxy experienced cycles of rise and collapse. Ancient empires gave way to republics, which in turn fell to dictatorships. Heroes emerged from obscurity, destinies intertwined across generations, and legends were born through acts of defiance and redemption. Technology advanced, but the core struggles between freedom and control, light and darkness, remained constant.

The struggle over how the Force should be used defines much of galactic history. 

For thousands of years, the Galactic Republic served as a representative government, uniting thousands of star systems under a shared legal and economic framework. Protected by the Jedi Order, the Republic valued diplomacy over conquest, but its bureaucracy grew slow and corrupt. Hidden within its political system, the Sith patiently worked to undermine it from within, using deception rather than open warfare to achieve dominance. 

The Jedi Order followed a strict code emphasizing discipline, selflessness, and emotional restraint. In contrast, the Sith embraced passion, ambition, and the pursuit of power. This philosophical divide led to countless wars across galactic history. Though often believed extinct, the Sith survived in secret, following the Rule of Two, ensuring that their power grew concentrated and focused over time. 

The fall of the Republic marked the rise of the Galactic Empire, an authoritarian regime built on fear and military supremacy. Emperor Palpatine, once a respected statesman, revealed himself as a Sith Lord and seized absolute control. The Jedi were hunted down and nearly exterminated, while planetary systems were brought into line through intimidation, propaganda, and overwhelming force. 

Opposition to the Empire formed slowly, as senators, soldiers, and civilians united in secret. This resistance evolved into the Rebel Alliance, a decentralized movement relying on courage, sacrifice, and hope rather than superior firepower. The Alliance fought to restore freedom to the galaxy, believing that tyranny was neither inevitable nor eternal. 

Across millennia, the galaxy experienced cycles of rise and collapse. Ancient empires gave way to republics, which in turn fell to dictatorships. Heroes emerged from obscurity, destinies intertwined across generations, and legends were born through acts of defiance and redemption. Technology advanced, but the core struggles between freedom and control, light and darkness, remained constant. 

Star Wars is a science fantasy universe set in a distant galaxy, where advanced technology coexists with ancient traditions, mysticism, and endless conflict. At the heart of the setting lies the Force, an energy field created by all living things, binding the galaxy together. Those sensitive to the Force can learn to manipulate it, gaining abilities that appear miraculous to ordinary beings.
